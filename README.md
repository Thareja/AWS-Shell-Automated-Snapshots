# AWS-Shell-Automated-Snapshots
A few different ways you can create snapshots in Amazon Web Services. Automatically tagging them. Automatically deleting them after a certain retention period. And I also had the scripts send me backup log emails so I know my instances were being backed up.

Also this was for a company that was doing hosting. So we added the following tags:

Name, 
Owner, 
StackName, 
CustomerName

And using these tags we tagged the snapshots as well.

Hope its useful. 

Cheers!
